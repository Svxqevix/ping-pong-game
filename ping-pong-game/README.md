# React Ping Pong Game

A simple, browser based Ping Pong game built with React and TypeScript.
The game features two paddles (left: W/S keys, right: Arrow Up/Down) and a moving ball that bounces off paddles and walls. If the ball passes either side, the game ends.

## Features

- Real‑time paddle movement using keyboard controls

- Ball movement with basic collision detection

- Start, pause, and restart controls

- Clean React component structure

- Fully typed with TypeScript

- Lightweight and fast thanks to Vite

- Currently, two official plugins are available:


## Controls
|Player | Keys |
|:------|:-----|
|Left Paddle | W (Up), S (Down)|
|Right Paddle | Arrow Up, Arrow Down|

## Getting Started

#### Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
```

#### Run the Development Server:

#### Compile the Application:

```
npm run build

##### Crafted with React, TypeScript, and a stubborn refusal to lose at Pong.
